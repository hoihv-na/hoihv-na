1. Request Mr Crishtian send customer’s consumption on first day of each month (Ex: Pls send me customer’s consumption 03/2022 for Airtime service)

2. Upload file to server 10.121.5.78
- Compress zip file before upload
- Upload to /u02/airtime/CdrReader/cdr/bi2
- After upload done --> unzip file uploaded: unzip uploadedfile.zip

3. Move file to import
- Move file: mv /u02/airtime/CdrReader/cdr/bi2/uploadedfile.csv /u02/airtime/CdrReader/cdr/bi

4. Check after import
- After import done (don't see file on /u02/airtime/CdrReader/cdr/bi)
- Compare number of imported record and number of line on CDR file. If it's same --> OK
	+ Check imported record: select count(1) from consumption_MMyy;

5. Calculate customer (if import OK)
- Run sql: input day is previous month (Ex: if now is 04/2022 then input is 03/2022)
begin
    calc_customer(to_date('202203','yyyymm'));
end;

- Check after
select count(1) from customer_2;
select count(1) from consumption_MMyy;
--> It's same --> OK

select count(1) from customer_2 where basic_money >= 100 and last_tot_cost >= 100;
--> It's the number of customer can be loan in this month
select count(1) from customer where basic_money >= 100 and last_tot_cost >= 100;
--> It's the number of customer can be loan in the previous month

6. Swap data
- Check before
select count(1) from customer;
select count(1) from customer_2;

- Execute
rename customer to customer_3;
rename customer_2 to customer;
rename customer_3 to customer_2;

- Check after
select count(1) from customer;
select count(1) from customer_2;
--> If the number is swapped --> OK
